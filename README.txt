Each question of our research has its own R script, they can be found in the corresponding folders.
Our report has three appendices. The first one is a separate file containing the clustering results 
of the first few weeks that did not make it into the final results (done by Marthe), 
and the other two are encorporated into our report to show additional figures.
We did not quite figure out how to remove some of the template headers / footer, I hope you don't mind.
Enjoy.
